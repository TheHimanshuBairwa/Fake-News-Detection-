- In this Project we are trying to classify whether the news is fake or not.
- For that we are using libraries like Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) Vectorizer and Passive Aggressive Classifier.
- For calculating Performance metric we are using Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix.
- Dataset is available in CSV format
- After applying these we are getting Accuracy of 92.93%, which is quite good.
